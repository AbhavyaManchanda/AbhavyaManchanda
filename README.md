# 👋 Hey there! I'm Abhavya Manchanda

I'm a final-year CS student who recently woke up and chose **grind**.  
Currently building cool stuff with Java, Spring Boot, and React – because sleeping is for people with fewer dreams.

---

### 👀 Interests
- 🚀 Full-stack development (Java + React)
- 🧠 Solving algorithmic puzzles and pretending it’s fun
- 🛠️ Building projects that are *actually* usable
- ☕ Clean code, better systems, fewer bugs (in theory)

---

### 🌱 Currently Learning
- Spring Boot like it owes me money  
- System design basics (one load balancer at a time)  
- How to not burn out after 3 LeetCode mediums

---

### 🤝 Looking to Collaborate On
- Java-based open source projects  
- Anything full-stack with clear goals and messy code  
- Projects that need an obsessive bug-fixer with dark mode enabled
